# `vault-init`

`vault-init` is a small utility for automating the initialization and unsealing of HashiCorp Vault. It draws inspiration from [kelseyhightower/vault-init](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/vault-init), but doesn't rely on any public cloud infrastructure for the encrypting and storing of Vault's root tokens and unseal keys.
